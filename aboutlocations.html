    <p>Dixie Castle is a well known steakhouse with a various menu. It is a family-run diner that's very homey and welcoming to all. This restaurant has been open and ran by owner, Mark Hudgens, for around 20 years. The restaurant has three locations which can be easily accessible and are linked up below. The history of DC is very heartwarming as well. Dixie Castle opened 84 years ago in 1936, across the street from the Jackson Sun. Showcases and pictures of the old restauruant still hang in the new, present day restaurant. Over time, more locations opened up around town. In present day times, the restaurant still has 3 locations standing. The well-known one resides in Downtown Jackson on 215 E Baltimore Street, in Jackson, Tennessee. Their open hours differentiate depending on the day and whether it's lunch or dinner shift. On Monday-Tuesday their lunch shift is from 10:30AM-2PM. And the dinner shift is from 5-9PM. On Saturdays they only have a dinner shift from 5-9PM. And then on Sunday they are closed.
